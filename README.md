After that, clone the web URL and go to the command line. Make sure python is downloaded onto your device and then input this command into the comand line: git clone https://github.com/imartinez/privateGPT && cd privateGPT && \
python3.11 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate && \
pip install --upgrade pip poetry && poetry install --with ui,local && ./scripts/setup
