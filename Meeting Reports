Discussion- We all created our different srs files that we then combined into one final srs that we submited into the srs branch. Then we went on to create the wireframe/GUI model that we uploaded into the
GUI.png and the GUI.py that created for that GUI requirement. Were we used Tkinter to create just a quick outline of what we want it to look like. Then we went in and found a simple tasks for the different
classes that we submitted into the classes.png and we will further be expaniding as we move along the different requierments. With altogehter we submited all the tasks to the trello that has also been linked
to the trello.
Questions- How to implement the GUI into code? Which we found out that Tkinter would be our best option as of right now.
What other classes are you looking for in the requirements?
How can we design the chatbox to our liking and where can we find that?
